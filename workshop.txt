description=[h2]Information[/h2]
description=[i]Can't tell if your flashlight is on during the day? Is your lighter suddenly missing? Not sure if those are your headlights or your hand torch?[/i]
description=Flashlight Indicator solves all of these issues by displaying an icon above or below your character to let you know when you're holding a light source and whether or not it's emitting light.

description=[h3]Mod Support[/h3]
description=[b]Flashlight Indicator supports both [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2815552312]Mod Config Menu[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169435993]Mod Options[/url][/b].
description=This mod provides several settings to modify the icons' appearances and behaviour. Although not required, if you want to access these settings you'll need one of the mods listed above.
description=That being said, I highly recommended you use Mod Config Menu as it provides more ways to configure settings and in the future may contain exclusive settings not included in Mod Options.
description=
description=Flashlights attached to a belt with a mod such as Braven's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2875848298]Common Sense[/url] are also supported.
description=
description=In the near future, I will be releasing an add-on that will allow the icons to be displayed as a moodle. This is not included in the main mod because it has a framework dependency I felt would be restrictive for the rest of the mod.
